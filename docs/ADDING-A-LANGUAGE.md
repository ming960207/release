# Adding a language

1. Copy `src/Filee.App/Assets/i18n/en.json` to `<code>.json` (e.g. `ja.json`, `de.json`, `zh-TW.json`).
   The file is a flat list of `"key": "text"` pairs.
2. Translate the values. Keep `{0}`, `{1}` placeholders — a test checks they match English.
   Keep the text short where English is short (buttons, donut labels).
3. Register the language in `AppLanguages.All` (`src/Filee.App/Services/AppLanguages.cs`) with its native name,
   e.g. `("ja", "日本語")`; the order there is the order of the language pickers. Setup (`src/Filee.Setup`) offers it
   too. If the OS culture should pick it automatically, extend `LocalizationService.Resolve`.
4. `LocalizationTests.Languages` automatically checks every registered language for key and placeholder parity.
5. If the script needs another font, add a static Noto font to `build/fetch-fonts.ps1`
   and to the font list in `SoftPalette.FontFamilies` (variable fonts are not supported by Avalonia).
   A language written right to left (Arabic) mirrors every window by itself (`SoftPalette.ApplyFlowDirection`).
   Pictures and drawings that must not mirror (the donut, the crop canvas, animated images, logos) set
   `FlowDirection="LeftToRight"` on themselves; custom-drawn text is shaped in the UI culture's direction, as
   `DonutMenu` does.
6. Run `dotnet test` and look at the screenshots in `tests/Filee.App.Tests/bin/.../screenshots`
   (add your language to `RenderTests.Pages` to render a few pages).

Missing keys fall back to English at runtime, but the test suite requires every language to be complete.

Optional, but welcome in the same or a later pull request: a translated README. Add `README.<code>.md` and link
it from the language line at the top of the other READMEs.

## Adding a UI string

Add the key to **all** language files in the same pull request. In XAML use
`Text="{DynamicResource my.key}"`; in code use `ILocalizer["my.key"]` or `ILocalizer.Format("my.key", arg)`.
